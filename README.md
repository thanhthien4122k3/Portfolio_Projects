# Thanh Thien - Data Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Thanh Thien! I'm currently a student at Hanoi University with a deep passion for working with data. I'm eager to apply my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science, where my data-driven approach can make an impact.

Throughout my studies, I've developed the ability to work with complex datasets, and I've sharpened my skills in spotting patterns and trends. My experience in analytical techniques, data management, and statistics will be a strong foundation as I continue to grow as a data enthusiast.

In my free time, I love exploring new data analysis tools and methods, always looking for ways to expand my knowledge. Whether collaborating with others or working on my own, I'm motivated by uncovering insights and using data to solve intricate challenges.


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.


### Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
**Code:** [`Score_Project_Analytics.ipynb`](https://github.com/thanhthien4122k3/Portfolio_Projects/blob/70f06f16f835f0a6ed8637c373bc773f8c4c77a9/Score_Project_Analytics.ipynb)

**Objective:** Forecasting the national high school benchmark score spectrum in 2024.

**Description:** The project focuses on analyzing a set of scores collected from 2020 to 2024. The dataset includes the number of subjects, subject names, and provinces. The project includes data loading, cleaning and pre-processing, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between subjects and total scores by block, and implementing correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrix, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions, the analysis shows that the benchmark scores of schools in 2024 increased by 0.25 - 0.5 compared to 2023.


### Explore Human source data
**Code:** [`HR_PROJECT.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

**Description:** Dataset of ID, name, department, start and end dates, plus location.
