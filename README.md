# Thanh Thien - Data Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Thanh Thien! I'm currently a student at Hanoi University with a deep passion for working with data. I'm eager to apply my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science, where my data-driven approach can make an impact.

Throughout my studies, I've developed the ability to work with complex datasets, and I've sharpened my skills in spotting patterns and trends. My experience in analytical techniques, data management, and statistics will be a strong foundation as I continue to grow as a data enthusiast.

In my free time, I love exploring new data analysis tools and methods, always looking for ways to expand my knowledge. Whether collaborating with others or working on my own, I'm motivated by uncovering insights and using data to solve intricate challenges.


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
